# Solitare-Game

This repository contains the source code for a Java program that simulates a game of solitaire. This game utilizes stack classes, embodying concepts discussed in computer science lectures regarding data structures.

The game is played with a standard deck of 52 cards, each having one of the thirteen ranks (ace to king, which correspond to integers 0-12 respectively) and one of the four suits (club, diamond, heart, and spade, which correspond to integers 0-3 respectively). Note that jokers are not utilized in this game.

The aim of this program is to mimic the process and rules of a solitaire game, eliminating the need to physically handle a deck of cards. The program implements the game rules, manages the game state, and provides a textual output of each state change so users can observe the game progress.
